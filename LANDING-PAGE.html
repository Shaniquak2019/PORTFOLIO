							<p>DURATION OF PROJECT COMPLETION: </br> 1/1/20 - 1/22/20</p>
							<p>This piece was designed as a landing page for <i>artist</i>, Chris Brown. I was inspired to do this page for him because of his <i>strong</i> connection to art. Aside from music, Chris has an obsession with designing and creating artwork. These interests really shows in his official website. Everything from the home page to merchandise page is very vibrant and "pops". I included similar colors in my project along with a mural handmade by Chris. </p>
							<p>***IMPORTANT*** I am only responsible for the landing page on this project ! This was my first project as a designer / developer. The nav links were simply added to direct traffic from my <i>LANDING PAGE</i> to the <i>OFFICIAL</i> website and
              to showcase my creativity such as how I used the same color patterns.</p>
