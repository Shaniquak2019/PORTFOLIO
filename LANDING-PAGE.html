							<p>DURATION OF PROJECT COMPLETION: </br> 1/1/20 - 1/22/20</p>
							<p>This piece was designed as a landing page for <i>artist</i>, Chris Brown. I was inspired to do this page for him because of his <i>strong</i> connection to art. Aside from music, Chris has a deep passion for designing and creating artwork. These interests really show in his official website. I was drawn to his site because everything is very vibrant and "pops". I included similar colors in my piece along with a mural that was handmade by Chris. </p>
							<p>***IMPORTANT*** </br></br> I am only responsible for the landing page on this project ! The nav links were simply added to direct traffic from my <i>LANDING PAGE</i> to the <i>OFFICIAL</i> website.</p>
