							<p>DURATION OF PROJECT COMPLETION: 2/7/20 - 2/14/20</p>
							<p>This project was DIFFICULT to work on. It is a dedication to Kobe Bryant and his 13 year old daughter, Gianna. Kobe was one of my greatest inspirations since I was a young child. He always gave 2000% in everything he did. He was bigger than basketball. For my story line, I put that Kobe founded this school in 2018; retirement year. </p>
							<p>I was always into art so created a dream school that I named in his honor;</br> MAMBA SCHOOL OF ARTS.</p>
