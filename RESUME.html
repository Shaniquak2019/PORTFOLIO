							<p>DURATION OF PROJECT COMPLETION: </br> 1/22/20 - 2/5/20</p>
							<p>This resume was made using CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap. The inspiration for this piece came from my desire to make a web version of my resume, opposed to just a paper version. As a designer, I felt it was important to display my creativity by showcasing the new skills I recently learned! This was my first time working with a framework. I had an issue with positioning the skills section, but once I did research on how the column grids work in Boostrap, I was able to get it the way I wanted it.   </p>
